# A simple Python currency converter

This script get the current Google Finance quote from USD to BRL using **urllib** native module, without any external packages or libs.

At this moment, only USD to BRL conversion is created, but is in my plans to add some features like other currencies, decimal and thousand dynamic separator, etc.

## How to use
1. Run `python usd_brl.py` and put the value that you want to convert. Example: `python usd_brl.py 1000,00`
2. Enjoy!
